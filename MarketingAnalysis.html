                                        <b>Decreased Conversion Rates:</b> <br />
                                        The conversion rate demonstrated a strong rebound in December, reaching 10.3%, despite a notable dip to 5.1% in October.<br />
                                        <b>Reduced Customer Engagement:</b><br />
                                        - There is a decline in overall social media engagement, with views dropping throughout the year.<br />
                                        - While clicks and likes are low compared to views, the click-through rate stands at 15.37%, meaning that engaged users are still interacting effectively.<br />
                                        <b>Customer Feedback Analysis:</b><br />
                                        - Customer ratings have remained consistent, averaging around 3.6 throughout the year.<br />
                                        - Although stable, the average rating is below the target of 4.0, suggesting a need for focused improvements in customer satisfaction, for products below 3,5.

                                        <b>General Conversion Trend:</b><br />
                                        - Throughout the year, conversion rates varied, with higher numbers of products converting successfully in months like February and July. This suggests that while some products had strong seasonal peaks, there is potential to improve conversions in lower-performing months through targeted interventions.<br />
                                        <b>Lowest Conversion Month:</b><br />
                                        - May experienced the lowest overall conversion rate at 4.5%, with no products standing out significantly in terms of conversion. This indicates a potential need to revisit marketing strategies or promotions during this period to boost performance.<br />
                                        <b>Highest Conversion Rates:</b><br />
                                        - January recorded the highest overall conversion rate at 19.6%, driven significantly by the Ski Boots with a remarkable 150% conversion. This indicates a strong start to the year, likely fueled by seasonal demand and effective marketing strategies.

                                        <b>Opportunity for Improvement:</b><br />
                                        - The presence of mixed positive and mixed negative sentiments suggests that there are opportunities to convert those mixed experiences into more clearly positive ones, potentially boosting overall ratings. Addressing the specific concerns in mixed reviews could elevate customer satisfaction.
